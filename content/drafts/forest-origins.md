A little over a year ago, I started my first year of medical school. The hopes of becoming a physician washa recurring theme of my life since forever so, naturally, the excitement I had going into this new chapter was unmatched. And now as someone one year into the field, I can testify that the excitement was reasonable- medicine is astounding; I'm glad that I ultimately chose to pursue this path.

But even so, within the past year, I've experienced a series of failures, many setbacks, too many occasions that accentuated the toxic "I don't belong here" mentality. This was the year that I learned of the true heartbreaks from the moments, times, opportunities, just freaking ANY personal progression, that depression robs you of. Not only that-this conspicuous entity can sometimes influence you to forget who you are. I would know-I mean, I remember the times when I would notoriously call every single friend in my contacts list, just cause I wanted company during a weekly Walmart run. Now, I purposely and wholeheartedly choose isolation- even though it makes me unhappy. And I don't understand (ok maybe I do understand) why.

When I started noticing these changes, I became heavily impacted by them. So, of course, I thought of anything and everything I could do to simmer out these strange new feelings. And alongside all that, I've been having these internal battles with entities that I can't even put a word to yet.
