OK, so something that my boyfriend brought up today that I don’t know why I hadn’t considered before. Maybe I was just in a Debbie downer mood and accepted my fate of being a dropout failure lol. BUT…. Let me give you a little bit more contacts on my academic history… 

So, at Dell Medical School during first year, we have five blocks and with the first two blocks I did fine. The third block which is called structure and function, which is basically the anatomy and physiology course for us, is where I started to struggle for the midterm. To pass the course, you have to get an average grade of 70 between both your lab midterm and lab Final as well as the written midterm and written final. 

I passed the lab practical, but I did not pass the written. I worked my ass off to study for the final and I ended up passing the lab practical final and improving a lot on the written exam for the final, but not enough to pull to a passing grade. So I had to take a remediation exam for the written portion, which I ended up passing. SO… tldr: I passed structure and function. The fourth block was also no trouble. I passed that one, but then the fifth block called mechanisms of disease, which is our pathology course is when I started to struggle again at this point the struggles were definitely beyond just academic problems. There was an array of mental well-being and other personal struggles. The outline of passing the course was similar to structure function and innocence. I did not pass the midterm OR the final, thus I didn’t pass the course…  so…  remediation was warranted and I did NOT pass that either… so alas, we come to the discussion of repeating the year. 

After talking it through with the previous associate dean of student affairs director, there were a couple of options for me at this point. I could: 1.) Argue for myself to only retake the course that I had failed, which is the last block, MOD, or 2.) Retake the two courses that I struggled in so both structure function and mechanisms of disease, or 3.) Retake basically the third block and on since it would be a little weird to pop in to the school year, only to leave for a block and then come back, but this was at the bottom of my preference choice, along with… 4.) retake the entire year. I believed that the best way for me to go about this was option 2. My rationale for this pretty much revolved around:

1. Structure and function represents the normal physiology and anatomy foundations that are pretty much critical to know in order to do well with understanding the pathology so I felt like it would be doing myself a disservice if I didn’t retake a course that is obviously so important and one that I struggled with. 
2. With all that free time from now until the beginning of the first course in between the two blocks, 

way, I could spend some time reevaluating my life and making sure that I set up a better system this time around in order to succeed and I’ll be giving the opportunity to address the stuff that I struggled with the first time solid foundation (and eventually the entire committee board) we came to the consensus That’s the best course of action for me would be to retake structure function and
