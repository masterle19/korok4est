## the encounter

In our first year of medical school, we go through the basics, of course. For now, let's put aside the portions of early medical training that's not that fun to talk about and fkcos on the purely clinical aspects of first year. Maybe it was my lack of experience with such skills, but the beginnings of my clinical skills course started off with me being a nerve-wracking mess. Overtime, you get more comfortable; things get boring. Nothing you do truly feels "doctor-worthy" but of course, it's not supposed toâ€”I mean,**WOT A FIRST YEAR MED STUDENT BOUTA DO HERE HUH? ðŸ’€**

  

But thatâ€™s not to say that all clinical related things that youâ€™ve learned in first year is pointless as a matter fact because my school is accelerated the idea behind their curriculum, is to try and expedite the book reading process to get us in the hospital interacting with patients and practicing clinical skills as soon as possible, which I am an advocate for because the most meaningful experience that Iâ€™ve had in the field of medicine so farâ€”an experience that probably paints the picture of why I stay, despite the harsh timesâ€”happened during my second semester of first year of medical school. The way it works is Â this: the first semester you learn the nitty-gritty things that every medical student across the face of this earth, learns, and then in second semester you start putting those skills to practice, which is comparatively to other medical schools pretty early. Who knows what you do during your third or fourth year those years are too far out for me to care about right now, but all of this is done with a mentor by your side. Now, when I first met my mentor during orientation I had no idea that I was going to be lead under the instruction of the best kind of medical leader. it was only after hearing about some of the experiences that my classmates were having with their mentors. Was I really able to come to appreciate how much this bad ass bitch has taught me everything I do all the steps that I take any progressions Iâ€™m aiming to make is all contributing towards the hopes of someday becoming a physician just like her.

  

So back to the patient encounter,
