> For context: I had scrolled through my old Google Photos and was pretty heartbroken by the numerous things I saw that reflected how certain events unfolded during my first year of medical school. This was my text to Jacob about how the texts I saw between old Thao and Jacob made me sad.

I think I know why I was so resilient back then. Or maybe I know a key factor that I was always in tune with that helped at least a little but. I feel like I’ve been, generally speaking, a "documenting/recording/capturing the moment" type girl, more so in the later parts of college than earlier on in my life but I feel like that’s when documentation should happen because you’ve learned so much and I remember I would always go and look through like my pictures or something every now and then. in the moment, I thought that I was just trying to revisit funny videos of Yogi or little clips of Matthew wearing lingerie just to laugh.

But now I feel like I was indirectly reflecting on my life consistently. I mean, if I was looking back at pictures and they weren’t bringing me joy or making me laugh then it would’ve been a moment of realization to me that something is not right and it seems like I always arrived at that realization relatively quick. So then.... The next thing that came was figuring out how to fix it.

But for the past year, I have been so negligent when it comes to reassessing anything going on in my life. All of that "AWHH LOOK WHAT WE WERE DOING LAST YEAR!" reflection completely stopped. It's like I knew that something is very wrong and if I were to just take a look through my drives, my photos, literally anything can be a receipt, I would have probably been able to spot the trend to fix it.

Then things got really bad to where I didn't even want to see any living proof of how terrible things had gotten.

The one thing that I felt was very consistent and stable for the most part in my life was my relationship with you. that’s why I’ve always been so grateful for all that you’ve done for me because you gave me so much comfort and solace during a period where everything else is quite literally deteriorating. but then I started feeling like things were different between us and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it but I think maybe that’s But reason why it affected me so much. And why it kinda hurt when your response was "what do you mean? I don't feel like anything’s changed.”

All of this combined plus the chaotic things I’m feeling seeing other stuff like my first text to dr. Monge… it’s just making me suddenly so worried that the one stability and source of hope in my life because it brought me so much comfort during hard times could potentially also slowly digress in the direction of everything else.

But of course, I know that’s not true I know that there’s definitely healthy boundaries established farther along relationship where we get comfortable and it’s just not realistic to believe that everything has to be the exactly same.

Like I said I’m just so vulnerable and broken. Seeing those messages just made me way more sad than I thought they would and that directly reflects the state of my life right now.

I think the awareness of the damage I’ve done is finally setting in cause I can everything I ignored for so long because I was cowardly. It’s just overwhelming right now.
