Today, I woke up feeling a huge sense of anhedonia. And as always, I also felt the subsequent guilt for not having the motivations to be a productive human being. Anyways, as most mornings go, I started my day by scrolling through the endless feeds of our phones, but later on, I decided to read one of winnie's blogs and WOW LUCKY ME-I ended up stumbling upon one of her posts titled "breaking out of rigid thinking"

"The act of making my bed no matter how tired, how busy or stressed I am, reinforces the idea that I am willing to allow my" wellbeing to come first (you have no idea how hard this is for me)"

My response to this: "omg sameeeee, girl!"... no like actually, when I make my bed, something in me feels uplifted, even if I wasn't previously in distress. And she's right these habits, especially the small ones, compound on each other until they generate enough momentum collectively build upon bigger things. Lately, I haven't been feeling so great. There's lots of convoluted problems at play here but one of the main ones is the fact that I think I've "broken my reward system' ?, but I think this will be a good start.

### here are some "wtf thao never does that" activities that i proudly claim to have finished:
- I ordered myself some food from La Madeleine! Normally, I'd go the day without eating.
- ﻿﻿Okay, listen
- I decided that I was going to make myyyy bed as well... but then I realized: what bed?!
- ﻿﻿So, I'm currently washing my sheets which is still okay because I'm trying to compound these habits; I'll get around to making that bed soon (also have not washed my bed in weeks so technically this isssss a "wif thao- ﻿﻿never does that") -and guesss what? I feel slightly more productive today than normal! YAS.

Context: for the past couple weeks or so, I've migrated much of my beddings to this corner in my apartment I call thao's corner; so basically I've been residing on the grounds for slumber... it was a vibe though.

Alright, well I have to admit that logging this today has already done something for me. I love thao's corner but I think a more orderly way of living might help me get back on my feet more and THIS is an obvious 1st step:
