> My understanding and adoption of a digital garden 

## Some definitions
 As with any definition, the first place to resort to is our best friend, [[Perplexity AI]]. Here is Perplexity's definition:
 
 > "A digital garden is a metaphor for an online space that allows for the cultivation, curation, and sharing of thoughts, ideas, notes, and knowledge. It is akin to a personal wiki or an experimental knowledge base that evolves over time. Unlike traditional blogs that are often organized chronologically, digital gardens are less about publishing polished content and more about the process of developing and nurturing ideas in a public or semi-public manner."
