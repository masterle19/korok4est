> Meet the Aliases of the Master Le corporation.


Sounds insane, but listen... This is actually the most organized methodology that I've arranged for myself that connects all of my interests

So I've fabricated this "company" called Master Le, Inc. Which Master Le the CEO being pretty much just me. In this company, there are departments like the ddxCLUE department focuses on  on my passions in medicine and comprises of Detective Le, the main lead investigator in charge of helping the team understand clinical case studies and why decisions are made in certain clinical situations and YOG1TRON the data-dawg that is the coder for the department in charge of developing cool medical apps aka the representation of my coding endeavors and interest. And then we have the Heart Designs department, which is my graphic designs representation. This is all basically me trying to rationalize all my interests and tie them together under one "company."
