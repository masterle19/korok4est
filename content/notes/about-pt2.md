i'm detective le and you've just stumbled into my forest-BOY do i got some places for you to go. well first off, i'm a medical student who is undeniably passionate about this field, so this forest is bound to have a shit ton of posts related to medicine. and on that note, there will be a lot of GUEST APPEARANCES from [[Detective Le]]—that bitch always be in this forest.

but to add onto that, i'm a medical student who is absolutely and unequivocally lost and confused. i started medical schoo last year and since then, i've had my fair shares of emotional turmoil and, well, here i am. recently, i've adopted this [[terrible habit]] and i'm trying to sort that out too. so with that, i'm hoping that this "forest" can be my own personal safespace; a space where i can dump my thoughts and feelings in so that they're ***at least expressed in some shape or form-kinda*** like... a DIGITAL THAO SPACE.

ok i've seen a lot of people turn their home-page into what looks like a virtual hang out spot. and i'm like WOT, i'm stealing.

(This is the spot where I insert the obnoxious map of hyrule with clickable spots that will lead you to very random & almost seemingly unrelated parts of my forest)
