I could sit here and strategically write out my rationale for the title of this page but honestly… it might be more worthwhile to take a gander at other people’s p

love the idea of bring able to query memories, thoughts, events, lessons learned etc from a personal learning library. 

It seems that the older we get, the moment in time when something happened or was experienced becomes less important than the event itself. 

X happened and I remember where I was and how I felt, but don’t ask me what year it was because I’ve no idea and will have to look it up using other resources like photos or tickets or tweets or emails. A query system would be fantastic.
