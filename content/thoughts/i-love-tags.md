I could sit here and strategically write out my rationale for the title of this page but honestly… it might be more worthwhile to take a gander at other people’s eloquently put together thoughts on this matter. And who better to put literally anyrhint & everything into the BEST words than my girl, WINNAY (spelling her name completely wrong right now just in case… It’s not likely, but if she stumbled upon this page right now I might be embarrassed… LMAO):
This is one of my absolute favorites posts that she’s written on [remembering forgotten lessons](https://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/). The whole motivation behind her website Heavily revolves around

love the idea of bring able to query memories, thoughts, events, lessons learned etc from a personal learning library. 

It seems that the older we get, the moment in time when something happened or was experienced becomes less important than the event itself. 

X happened and I remember where I was and how I felt, but don’t ask me what year it was because I’ve no idea and will have to look it up using other resources like photos or tickets or tweets or emails. A query system would be fantastic.
