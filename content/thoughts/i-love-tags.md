I could sit here and strategically write out my rationale for the title of this page but honestly… it might be more worthwhile to take a gander at other people’s eloquently put together thoughts on this matter. And who better to put literally anyrhint & everything into the BEST words than my girl, WINNAY (spelling her name completely wrong right now just in case… It’s not likely, but if she stumbled upon this page right now I might be embarrassed… LMAO):

This is one of my absolute favorites posts that she’s written on [remembering forgotten lessons](sort://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/). The whole motivation behind her website heavily revolves around this motivation to create sort of like an ongoing life repository of meaningful moments (or meaningless notes on something idiotically irrelevant?), curations of life lessons learnt, and insights discovered— it’s basically your own personal changelog. 

*(Insert more thoughts on this later…)*

Anyway… I mentioned that these websites are typically ones that are designed to be revisited Constantly and the influx of stuff coming in to such a site is never ending and, if you commit to it, quite expansive! Go look at some of these sites with a SHIT TON OF INFO. But generally speaking, the stuff that is written will typically fall under broad categories of topics that the owner of such divine korok forest holds near and dear to their heart. And that’s where tags come into the picture!  

But hear me out… a solid tagging system PLUS the ability to temporally query memories, thoughts, events, lessons learned, literally ANYTHING from a personal learning library is the game changer here. 

It seems that the older we get, the moment in time in which we experience something that is worse remembering, that experience began to decay like a ticking time bomb almost instantaneously. My little niece used to write down stupid insiders that popped up throughout our relationship growing up. These are quite random and more often times, they do be dumb ‘af. But I was surprised at how little I retained from that long ass list that she was committed to. Literally, some of these jokes were formed, not even a week ago, and they had already slept on my mind. There are many times when I venture into the depths of my poor Google Drive holding all of my photos and I’ll be reminded of something hilarious that me and Matthew cracked up over in the past. But had it not been for whatever photo or video that was taken during that particular moment, I probably would’ve never remembered that joke ever again. 

But fear NOT! That’s what them QUERIES BE FOR! AND AI ROBOT ARMIES!
