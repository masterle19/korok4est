>_So, Zelda has been waiting--oh I don't know--about 100 years for your ass to come save her from Calamity Ganon but, like, you literally just woke up from an overdue slumber and doing all that just don't feel like the move right now...which is completely okay! Because sometimes, you need to give yourself some **'you time'** and right now, 'you time' means setting your Sheikah Slate sensor to detect nothing but **Hearty Radishes** and inhaling those when the opportunity presents itself for you to do so. LMAO OK--in normal lingo: **Hearty Radishes are just cute little knick-knacks that aren't particularly super relevant in any major pillar of life but they do introduce some form of joy into my days, no matter how little. Most of the time, this will be other people's insanely creative work that I find online and will likely be taking inspo from sometime in the future.** For some reason, I'm flabbergasted by a lot of creative projects I encounter, no matter the topic that these creations revolve around. So, relative to one another, anything tagged with a #HeartyRadish is going to encompass a small fragment of my many distractions in this world and venturing down those types of post is going to get you spiraling down very odd (but prob very fun!) rabbit holes._
