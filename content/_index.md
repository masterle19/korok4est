### WOT are you doing in me forest, eh?
Come to get lost on in the GRAND ðŸŒ± [[notes/digital-garden|korok4est]] ðŸŒ± filled with ddx wonders and clues, eh? Curious about the mind of Master Le? Well, **lucky you**, because this korok4est is the place to BE for such a voyager. LOL OKAY, in other words...

## Walcam to Master Le's korok4est.
This is my rendition of a [[notes/digital-garden]]. A good place to start that we all love to ignore is the [[notes/about|about page]], but if you're not about that life, then here are some good starting points too:

- let me introduce you to... [[notes/masterle-inc|Master Le, Inc.]]â€”a wonderful company comprising of fabricated... BUT cool 'af members, each representing a facet of something I find cool.
- or... take it all the way back and meet the [[notes/master-le|master, herself]].
- here are [[things that I love]] 
- or, I don't know man, explore the [[notes/markdown|wonders of markdown]] with **YOG1TRON** or something.... JASS GO! EXPLORE!
